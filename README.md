# bio131
A repo containing my small project for Bio131. In order to run or open any of these files
you must have NumPy/SciPy installed, along with Python >= 3.5 and iPython/iPython
notebooks. To run, simply clone the repository (using `git clone https://github.com/guillean/bio131.git`)
and then open any of the files with the iPython notebook interface (by calling `ipython notebook` on
the current directory and opening the file you wish to read).

The content under `Gasket Color.ipynb` is based on the FLAM3 paper by Draves and Reckase, which can
be [found here](http://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf) and is *well worth* a read. It's only slightly
mathematical, but not a difficult read and is quite nice.
